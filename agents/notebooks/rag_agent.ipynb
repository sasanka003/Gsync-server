(mt): 41,500 (18%)\\n\\nImports till End of Jan 2024 (mt): 16,370 (7%)\\n\\nDeficit (mt): 151,898 (68%)\\n\\nPotato Production and Import Graph:\\n\\nShows monthly data from 2021 to 2024\\n\\nIncludes Yala and Maha harvest seasons\\n\\nTracks production (mt), imports (mt), monthly requirement (mt), and monthly availability (mt)\\n\\nProduction generally ranges between 5,000 to 10,000 mt\\n\\nImports fluctuate more widely, often exceeding 15,000 mt\\n\\nMonthly requirement appears constant at around 20,000 mt\\n\\nMonthly Balance Table (Maha harvest 2023/24):\\n\\nJanuary: Production 3,003 mt, Imports 16,370 mt, Requirement 18,750 mt, Availability 19,373 mt, Balance 623 mt\\n\\nFebruary: Production 4,474 mt, Requirement 18,750 mt, Availability 4,474 mt, Balance -13,653 mt\\n\\nMarch: Production 6,638 mt, Requirement 18,750 mt, Availability 6,638 mt, Balance -25,765 mt\\n\\nApril-June: No production, Requirement 18,750 mt each month, No availability, Increasing negative balance\\n\\nKey observations: 1. There\\'s a significant deficit in potato production compared to demand. 2. Imports play a crucial role in meeting the monthly requirement. 3. The Maha harvest season (typically November to March) shows higher production. 4. There\\'s a cyclical pattern in production and imports related to harvest seasons. 5. The monthly requirement remains constant at 18,750 mt, indicating stable demand.\\n\\nThis data suggests that Sri Lanka heavily relies on imports to meet its potato demand, especially during non-harvest months.'),\n",

Similarly, wholesale rice prices fell month-on-month in September in VietNam, mostly due to improved market supplies from the ongoing 2024 summer/autumn harvest.\\n\\nIn late September, the Government of India reduced the export tax on certain rice types, lifted the export ban on Indica white rice and imposed a minimum export price for all Indica white rice grades.\\n\\nHigh costs of agricultural inputs and transport, and conflict related market disruptions contributed to the price increases\\n\\nIn China (mainland), the wholesale national average price of Indica and Japonica rice varieties remained stable in September and were close to their year-earlier levels, reflecting adequate market availabilities from the 2024 early double and single crop harvests.\\n\\nSource: Food Price Monitoring Analysis – September 2024—FAO\\n\\nSocio Economics & Planning Centre , Department of Agriculture 14')]"
