### Assumptions
Seed Paddy requirement for Yala 2024* = Average sown extent Yala 21-23 * Seed paddy requirement per ha
Seed paddy requirement for Maha 2024/25 **= Same sown area as Maha 2023/24** Seed paddy requirement per ha
Seed paddy requiremnt per ha = 102.35 kg  (Following DOA reccomendations)
Wastage = 6% from paddy production
No use for animal feed and manufacturing
Total national rice requirement *** - Rice usage for rice based value added products (except rice packets brought from shops, hoppers, string
hoppers, & pittu), the differences of consumption pattern of rice in the persons live in collective quarters (bording places, hostels, baracks,
religious places) etc... are not considered for calculating national rice requirement

## How production forecast of each crop is made

Cultivated extent of crop reported as at the end of each month is multiplied by the average yield.

District wise paddy cultivation sown area was adjusted by the land factor (niyara)

Average yields are calculated

Based on the moving averages of district wise average yields (Source: Department of Census and Statistics) of past 3 years, which are further verified using the Cost of Cultivation Reports published by the Socio Economics and Planning Centre, Department of Agriculture and relevant crop leaders, research officers and field officers.

## How Production forecast is revised with crop damage

Crop Damages are reported as 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% yield reduction occurred area (ha) which are affected with each source of damage. The production loss is calculated based on the specified area damages and the respective yield losses.

# Regional Overview - Far East Asia

## FAR EAST

- In September 2024, domestic rice prices showed mixed trends month on month and were generally lower year-on-year in many countries of the subregion.

- In Thailand, wholesale rice prices declined for the fourth consecutive month in September, reflecting the recently started 2024 main harvest, with a production forecast at an above-average level and overall weak international demand in recent weeks.

- Overall, September prices were 15 percent down year-on-year. Similarly, wholesale rice prices fell month-on-month in September in VietNam, mostly due to improved market supplies from the ongoing 2024 summer/autumn harvest.

- In late September, the Government of India reduced the export tax on certain rice types, lifted the export ban on Indica white rice and imposed a minimum export price for all Indica white rice grades.

- High costs of agricultural inputs and transport, and conflict related market disruptions contributed to the price increases

- In China (mainland), the wholesale national average price of Indica and Japonica rice varieties remained stable in September and were close to their year-earlier levels, reflecting adequate market availabilities from the 2024 early double and single crop harvests.
